1.	Introduction
These days the mobile industry is in a constant development and their technologies don’t stop to improve. 
In particular the mobile applications sector has become one of the more active in the market. Indeed, these applications are easy and fast to use, everywhere and at any time, appealing the customers. 
The Enjoy Company provides a real-time car reservation service, where its clients can book electric cars near a given address and pick it within an hour. 
In order to satisfy their customers and ease the use of their services, Enjoy Company decides to build a mobile application: PowerEnjoy. 
This one creates a portable interface between the driver, his account and the available cars, enhancing the efficiency of the services.

1.1.	Purpose (goals)
The PowerEnjoy application needs the client to be registered in its database before he can reserve a car, for security and payment reasons (credential information, driver license, and identity card). 
After he logs in, the mobile app allows him to reserve a car around an address or his GPS position. 
Then it provides him information about his reservation on the main page. The application also allows the client to cancel his reservation and unlock the reserved car when he his near it.
After the ride the application locks the car and sends an email to the client with the bill of the ride. 
The mobile application can moreover give discounts and charges in function of the client’s ride such as sharing the car or plug it in power grid.  

The PowerEnjoy application is built in order to ensure an easy and clear reservation service as well as an effective data collecting and saving. 
This refers the PowerEnjoy application simplifies the customer’s uses, optimises the time to reserve a car and adjusts the price of the ride according to the driver. 

Goals:

G1: Allow user to register to the system  by providing credential and payment informations

G2: Allow user to log into the system with provided password

G3: User can locate available cars within a certain distance around him or an address

G4: User can book a car for up to 1hour before pick it up

G5: A booked car but not picked up within one hour generate 1€ fee for the user

G6: A user close enough to a car booked by him must be able to open it

G7: The system start charging once engine ignite

G8: The set of safe area is predefined by the management system

G9: The system stop charging once he leave the car parked in a safe area

G10: 10% discount on last ride if the car detect at least two passengers

G11: The system apply 20% discount on the last ride if the car is left with more than 50% battery (over full battery)

G12: If the user park the car in a special parking area, where the car can be charged, and take care to plug the car. The system apply 30% discount on the last ride.

G13: If the car is left with less than 20% battery or at more than 3km from the nearest power grid station, the system charges 30% more on the last ride.

G14: The user can enable the saving money option and so by giving his final destination to the system, this one is able give him a station as destination (based on distribution of cars algorithm and available plugs in the station as well as the final destination of the user) and so if the user leave the car at this place he will get a special discount.

1.2.	Scope (world, share phenomena)
With the improvement of mobile phones, which performances compete some laptops ’ones; the development of mobile applications is the best way to create reliable platforms for company. 
The PowerEnjoy application is a product reserved to mobile; it permits an easy access to internet connexion and GPS navigation (provides by the mobile phone) for running.
Clients are drivers who would use this application quickly in town, to reach specific places without using common transports or taxis. 
Drivers can reach any places in town because of the available parking widespread in it, covering the entirety of the city areas. Driver can easily found a car, the application main page giving a map to guide him to it. 
It is not expensive, Enjoy Company providing electric cars and drivers owning discounts by sharing it, plugging it or economizing the batteries. 
The driver’s ride is monitored by the sensors in the car, which communicate in real time to the application system, this one providing back the price, the discounts or charges on the navigation screen of the car. 
By this way the driver is constantly informed of the price, the discounts and the charges (ride not respectful to the other clients: low battery, not park in safe area) he has on his ride.
The navigation system of the cars is useful for the driver to find a safe area near his destination where he can park. The saving money option also helps him to find a special parking area to plug in the car.
