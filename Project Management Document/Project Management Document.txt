1.2.	Scope
The scope of the project PowerEnjoy, which is a service based on mobile application, is to manage, design, build, and implement a service aimed at facilitating public transportation. The application provides to its target, the client, a way to research an electric car near a position, reserve it and pick it for a ride. At the end the application sends the ride's bill to the client. The PowerEnjoy application needs the client to be registered in its database before he can reserve a car, for security and payment reasons (credential information, driver license, and identity card).  When the client logs in, the mobile application allows him to reserve a car around an address or his GPS position. Then it provides him details about his reservation on the main page.  The application also allows the client to cancel his reservation, unlock the reserved car when he is near it, and access his account details to modify it. 
After the ride the application locks the car and sends an email to the client with the bill of the ride. The mobile application can moreover give discounts and charges in function of the client’s ride such as sharing the car or plug it in power grid station. The PowerEnjoy application is built in order to ensure an easy and clear reservation service as well as an effective data collecting and saving.  This refers the PowerEnjoy application simplifies the customer’s uses, optimises the time to reserve a car and adjusts the price of the ride according to the driver.
