1.	Introduction

1.1.	Purpose
The Design Document provides a functional description of the PowerEnjoy's system. Its aim is to present the architectural design of the application and to explain the taken decisions for this choice.
This document is a technical description of the interaction between the software and the users and is intended to be a support for the developers.

1.2.	Scope (same as RASD)
The scope of the project PowerEnjoy, which is a service based on mobile application, is to manage, design, build, and implement a service aimed at facilitating public transportation.
The application provides to its target, the client, a way to research an electric car near a position, reserve it and pick it for a ride. At the end the application sends the ride's bill to the client.
The PowerEnjoy application needs the client to be registered in its database before he can reserve a car, for security and payment reasons (credential information, driver license, and identity card). 
When the client logs in, the mobile application allows him to reserve a car around an address or his GPS position. Then it provides him details about his reservation on the main page. 
The application also allows the client to cancel his reservation, unlock the reserved car when he is near it, and access his account details to modify it. 
After the ride the application locks the car and sends an email to the client with the bill of the ride. The mobile application can moreover give discounts and charges in function of the client’s ride such as sharing the car or plug it in power grid station.  
The PowerEnjoy application is built in order to ensure an easy and clear reservation service as well as an effective data collecting and saving. 
This refers the PowerEnjoy application simplifies the customer’s uses, optimises the time to reserve a car and adjusts the price of the ride according to the driver.

1.6.	Document structure
In the following parts of the document are describing the different part of the application's design and the needed RASD requirements. 
Architectural design
This section introduced the high level architecture of the PowerEnjoy system, its main components and interfaces, its runtime behavior and its design patterns.
Algorithm design
In this second part, the most critical parts are presented.To this end, some explicit algorithms in pseudocode are provided for the implementation. 
User interface design
This section provides an overview of the user interfaces of the application by giving mockup.
Requirements traceability
In this part are describing the RASD requirements that cover every design elements defined in the Design Document.
Finally the hours of work repartition follows this section.
